# Getting started with Swift on IBM Cloud
The Getting Started tutorial for Swift uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any Swift app; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on the cloud, and then integrate an IBM Cloud database service in your app.

The Swift app uses the [Kitura Web Framework](http://www.kitura.io/) and a [Cloudant NoSQL DB](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/cloudant) to illustrate how to store information in a database and then return information from a database to the UI. To learn more about how the app connects to Cloudant, see the [Kitura CouchDB Library](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Kitura-CouchDB).

Alternatively, this app can [connect to a MongoDB service](./README_MONGO.md). As described, this functionality requires the `libressl`, which is needed when running the application locally on macOS, even if using Cloudant.  Install it with `brew install libressl`.

The following steps are the general procedure to set up and deploy your app to IBM Cloud. See more detailed instructions in the [Getting started tutorial for Swift](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/runtimes/swift/getting-started.html#getting-started-tutorial).

## Before you begin

You'll need a [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview), and [Swift](https://swift.org/download/) installed.
